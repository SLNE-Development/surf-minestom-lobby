package dev.slne.minestom.lobby.server.player.visibility

/**
 * Selects player entity IDs using retention-weighted squared distances and hysteresis-based
 * visibility limiting.
 *
 * Candidates are ranked by ascending adjusted distance. Previously visible candidates have
 * their squared distance multiplied by the square of [retentionDistanceFactor]. Equal scores
 * favor previously visible candidates, then candidates with lower entity IDs.
 *
 * When limiting is inactive, all valid candidates are selected. When limiting is active,
 * at most [maxVisible] candidates are selected. Results are sorted by entity ID, not distance.
 *
 * Each selection pass consists of [begin], calls to [offer], and [finish]. Entity IDs must
 * be offered at most once per pass; duplicate offers are not deduplicated.
 *
 * Instances reuse internal buffers and are not thread-safe.
 *
 * @param maxVisible Maximum number of candidates selected while limiting is active.
 * Must be greater than zero.
 * @param activateAt Minimum valid candidate count that activates limiting when it was
 * previously inactive. Must be greater than or equal to [maxVisible].
 * @param deactivateBelow Valid candidate count below which active limiting is disabled.
 * Must be in `1..maxVisible` and strictly less than [activateAt].
 * @param retentionDistanceFactor Distance multiplier for previously visible candidates,
 * applied as its square to squared distances. Must be in `(0.0, 1.0]`. Smaller values
 * increase the retention preference; `1.0` preserves only the equal-score preference.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If any constructor argument violates its stated constraints.
